			purpose = <"To record the measurement of the pulse rate, or heart rate, and description of associated characteristics as one component of a vital signs observation.">
			use = <"Use to record the presence or absence of a pulse rate or heart rate. 

Use to record the measurement of the pulse rate, or heart rate, and observation about the associated rhythm.

Use to record a simple description of characteristics that are associated with the pulse or heart beat, that might be commonly recorded as part of a vital signs obervation.

Measurements such as the maximum pulse or heart rate over an interval of time can be recorded using \"Maximum' event. Others point-in-time or interval events may be specified within a template or at run-time.

In practice, the terms heart rate and pulse rate are often used interchangeably. This archetype allows either term to be used when the measurement site is not specified, to suit clincian preferences.

In certain situations, however, it is important to differentiate between a pulse rate observed at a peripheral artery, such as the radial artery, in contrast to the centrally observed heart rate. This archetype allows the data to be very specific and differentiate between central heart rate and the pulse rate recorded at a specified artery.">
			keywords = <"rate", "rhythm", "beat", "pulse", "heart", "vital", "sign">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record the R-R rate in the context of an Electrocardiograph report - this is to be recorded using the OBSERVATION.ecg archetype.

Not to be used to record other details of the full cardiovascular examination or assessment. Other specific CLUSTER archetypes will be used to record characteristics such as apex beat, murmurs and bruits, auscultatory findings,

In particular, this archetype is not intended to record the assessment of peripheral vascular disease, which requires documentation of the presence and strength of each peripheral pulse.  A specific CLUSTER archetype will be used to record the general findings on examiantion of peripheral pulses.  

Not to be used to record fetal heart rate - this is recorded using the OBSERVATION.fetal_heart archetype.

Concepts such as Target Heart Rate should be recorded in separate EVALUATION archetypes related to goals and exercise assessment.">
